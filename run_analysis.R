## You should create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following. 

# Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

subject_train shows the participant number
X_train is the data of which elements 1 - 6 of 561 are the mean and std

1 tBodyAcc-mean()-X
2 tBodyAcc-mean()-Y
3 tBodyAcc-mean()-Z
4 tBodyAcc-std()-X
5 tBodyAcc-std()-Y
6 tBodyAcc-std()-Z

y_train is the activity label (which can be found in a separate file called activity_labels)

# Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 

# Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

# Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 

# From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
